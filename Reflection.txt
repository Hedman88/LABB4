1. I learned a lot about methods and classes.

2. There wasn't a lot of difficult things to wrap your head around. The most difficult parts were getting tired and brain stopped functioning when it got late.
The difficulties in coding I mostly overcame by asking Magnus.

3. This lab was pretty good, but there was a lot of typing that didn't teach anything really. I guess you could call it repetition so I dunno if it was bad or good.

Estimated time: 10 hours and 10 minutes.
